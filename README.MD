Timeshape is a Java library that can be used to determine to which time zone a given geo coordinate belongs.
It's based on data published at
[https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder/releases](https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder/releases),
which itself is inherited from the OpenStreetMap data.

But what if knowing just time zone for a geo coordinate is not enough? Wouldn't it be nice to know more, like
administrative area or city neighborhood? Check out [GeoBundle](https://geobundle.com), now there's a Java library for that, too!

## Getting started

Timeshape is published on Maven Central. The coordinates are the following:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.iakovlev</groupId>
    <artifactId>timeshape</artifactId>
    <version>2023b.21</version>
</dependency>
```

Starting from release 2023b.20, Timeshape re-introduces support for Java 8. It was inadevrtently dropped in one of the previous releases,
but now it's brought back.

## Android

Android developers should add Timeshape to the app level gradle.build as follows:

```gradle
implementation('net.iakovlev:timeshape:2023b.21') {
  // Exclude standard compression library
  exclude group: 'com.github.luben', module: 'zstd-jni'
}
// Import aar for native component compilation
implementation 'com.github.luben:zstd-jni:1.5.5-11@aar'
```

## Using the library

The user API of library is in `net.iakovlev.timeshape.TimeZoneEngine` class. To use it, follow these steps:

#### Initialization

Initialize the class with the data for the whole world:

```java
import net.iakovlev.timeshape.TimeZoneEngine;
TimeZoneEngine engine = TimeZoneEngine.initialize();
```

Or, alternatively, initialize it with some bounding box only, to reduce memory usage:

```java
TimeZoneEngine engine = TimeZoneEngine.initialize(47.0599, 4.8237, 55.3300, 15.2486);
```

It is important to mention that for the time zone to be loaded by the second method,
it must be covered by the bounding box completely, not just intersect with it.

During initialization, the data is read from resource and the index is built.
Initialization takes a significant amount of time (approximately 1 second), so do it only once in program lifetime.

Data can also be read from an external file, see overloads of `TimeZoneEngine.initialize` that accept
`TarArchiveInputStream`. The file format should be same as produced by running `builder` sbt project
(see [here](doc/Architecture.md#builder)).
It is responsibility of caller to close input stream passed to `TimeZoneEngine.initialize`.

#### Query for `java.time.ZoneId`:

Once initialization is completed, you can query the `ZoneId` based on latitude and longitude:

```java
import java.util.Optional;
import java.time.ZoneId;
Optional<ZoneId> maybeZoneId = engine.query(52.52, 13.40);
```

#### Multiple time zones for single geo point

Starting from release 2019b.7, the data source from which Timeshape is built contains overlapping geometries.
In other words, some geo points can simultaneously belong to multiple time zones. To accommodate this,
Timeshape has made the following change. It's now possible to query all the time zones, to which given
geo point belongs:

```java
List<ZoneId> allZones = engine.queryAll(52.52, 13.40);
```

The `Optional<ZoneId> query(double latitude, double longitude)` method is still there, and it still returns
maximum one `ZoneId`. If given geo point belongs to multiple time zones, only single one will be returned.
Which of multiple zones will be returned is entirely arbitrary. Because of this, method
`Optional<ZoneId> query(double latitude, double longitude)` is not suitable for use cases where such choice must
be deliberate. In such cases use `List<ZoneId> queryAll(double latitude, double longitude)` method and apply further
business logic to its output to choose the right time zone. Consult file
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder/master/expectedZoneOverlaps.json
for information about areas of the world where multiple time zones are to be expected.

#### Querying polyline

Timeshape supports querying of multiple sequential geo points (a polyline, e.g. a GPS trace) in an optimized way using method
`List<SameZoneSpan> queryPolyline(double[] points)`. Performance tests (see `net.iakovlev.timeshape.PolylineQueryBenchmark`)
show significant speedup of using this method for querying a polyline, comparing to separately querying each point from polyline 
using `Optional<ZoneId> query(double latitude, double longitude)` method:

```
Benchmark                                  Mode  Cnt  Score   Error  Units
PolylineQueryBenchmark.testQueryPoints    thrpt    5  2,188 ▒ 0,044  ops/s
PolylineQueryBenchmark.testQueryPolyline  thrpt    5  4,073 ▒ 0,017  ops/s
```
